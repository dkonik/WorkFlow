# WorkFlow

This was created for a hackathon (that is my excuse for why the code follows almost no style guidelines whatsoever
and is so hastily put together).

It's goal is to be a workflow application that helps me multitask. Think of it like sticky notes, but with threading. 
For example, say I have two dev environments set up so that while one is compiling, I can make progress on
the other. Now let's say that the one I'm compiling has errors. I want to switch back to it, fix those errors and 
get it compiling again. That said, it would be nice to leave myself a little note as to where I left off on the 
other environment so that when I switch back it doesn't take me as long to figure out where I left off.

That is where this application comes in; its rightward flowing progress with git inspired branching and merging 
could (theoretically) help.
